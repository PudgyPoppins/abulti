# Abulti Apparel

This is the code for the *massively* popular Abulti Apparel website

## TODO:
* Before deployment:
	* Get actual images of products on the site.
	* Change DEBUG.text to False
	* Change robots.txt to allow site indexing
	* Create a .xml sitemap for google to index the site in the first place


## Questions to answer for moving forward (website related and bussiness related):

* Under what circumstances would we offer somebody a return?

* How do we ensure that our packages arrive at their destinations?

* Do we have multiple shirt sizing available? Would weird sizes be available upon request? idk
