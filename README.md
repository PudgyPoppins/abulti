# Abulti Apparel

This is the code for the *massively* popular Abulti Apparel website

## TODO:

* Filling in content, like about page, mission statement, metadata descriptions, etc
* Terms of service (should not be created by me, more of a "download a boilerplate from the internet and use that" kind of thing)
	* Get as close to plagarising another company's ToS as possible

* A lot of help pages to go with
	* Inform customers about shipping, returns, contacting us, etc

* Before deployment:
	* Change DEBUG.text to False
	* Change robots.txt to allow site indexing
	* Create a .xml sitemap for google to index the site in the first place


## Questions to answer for moving forward (website related and bussiness related):

* Under what circumstances would we offer somebody a return?

* How do we ensure that our packages arrive at their destinations?

* Do we have multiple shirt sizing available? Would weird sizes be available upon request? idk
